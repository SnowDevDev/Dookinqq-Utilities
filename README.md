# A Greek Tragedy

Skidded addon i made to assist u in (anarchy) servers.
While still in early dev, it has more than 40 modules.
It also has grim features to assist with BepHax or mioclient.me if i/somebody can port it correctly.

### Origins

This project started when i saw the server "SnowCapSMP" on minehut.gg, then it grew into a universal project for all anarchy/grim servers.
